#LOCAL_PATH					project path

#LOCAL_CFLAGS				
#								-c			Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.
#								-std=c++1y	The next revision of the ISO C++ standard, tentatively planned
#											for 2014. Support is highly experimental, and will almost certainly
#											change in incompatible ways in future releases.

#									 c++1z
#									 c++11
#								-Wall		This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users consider
#											questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to prevent the warning),
#											even in conjunction with macros.
#								-pedantic	Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++
#								-g			Produce debugging information in the operating systemâ€™s native format
#								-O2			Optimize even more
#LOCAL_CPP_FEATURES			
#LOCAL_LDLIB				
#LOCAL_SRC_FILES			source files
